## Graph Representation

We'll represent our dataset as a graph, where DNA segments (contigs) are vertices, and their significant overlaps are edges. To optimize memory usage, we'll map original identifiers to integer IDs using a hashmap. We will also filter out overlaps less than 1000 to focus on sufficiently large overlaps.

## Graph Analysis

Our graph analysis will include:

1. **Node Degree Distribution:** Assessing the number of overlaps each DNA segment has.
2. **Components:** Identifying connected subsets within our graph.
3. **Component Density Distribution:** Calculating the density of each component.

## Data Visualization

We'll use Python's Matplotlib to visualize our data (histograms)

## Graph Algorithms

Traversal algorithms like DFS and BFS will be used for graph exploration and component identification. While not directly relevant, shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford) could be considered for future expansions. We also need to find connected components in the graph.
