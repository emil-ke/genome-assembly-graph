# 2023-05-15 --- Breakdown of some problems

## Graph Representation

We can use a HashMap, where the original identifier is the key,
and the value is a unique but shorter identifier (e.g., an integer ID). This way, we can effectively minimize memory consumption.

Another aspect to consider is the filtering of overlaps. In this project, only overlaps of length 1000 or more are considered
"sufficiently large". Thus, we should filter out any edges that do not meet this criterion.

## Graph Analysis

The main computational problems to solve involve analysis of the graph:

1. **Node Degree Distribution:** This refers to the number of edges incident to (connected to) each node. In this context,
   it reflects how many DNA segments each segment overlaps with.

2. **Components:** A component in a graph is a subset of the graph in which every two vertices are connected to each other by a path,
   and which is connected to no additional vertices in the graph.

3. **Component Density Distribution:** This involves calculating the fraction of actual edges over the number of all possible edges
   for each component.

## Data Visualization

---

Visualizing the data can help in better understanding the structure of the graph. Histograms and tables can be used for summarizing
the distributions and conveying the results in a human-friendly manner. Libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn in Python or equivalents
in Java could be used for this purpose.

## Graph Algorithms

Several graph algorithms could be utilized for this project:

1. **Traversal Algorithms (DFS, BFS):** These could be used for exploring the graph, finding components, and other tasks.
2. **Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford):** These could potentially be used for finding the shortest path
   between two segments, although this may not be directly relevant to the current problem.
3. **Graph Connectivity Algorithms:** These could be used to find connected components in the graph.

## Repository Structure

The repository should be well-organized, with separate directories for different types of files. For instance:

- `src`: Contains all source code (Java files, scripts, etc.)
- `data`: Contains the data file(s) used in the project
- `doc`: Contains the report and lab notebook (Markdown files)

## Lab Notebook

The lab notebook should be maintained regularly with entries for each day of work. It should include technical details, decisions made,
commands run, data produced, and suggestions for future work. It should be clear, concise, and informative for both the current and future
self, as well as any potential collaborators.

## Report

The report should be written in a way that it clearly describes the work done and the results obtained. It should be comprehensible for the
imaginary collaborator. It should include:

- The problem and the approach to solve it
- Details of the algorithms used, their suitability, limitations, and experiences with them
- The results and their interpretation

The report should be written in Markdown format and stored in the `doc` directory in the repository.
