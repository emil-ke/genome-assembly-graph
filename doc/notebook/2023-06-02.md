Finished the node distribution part of the project today.

I started by creating small test data files (this is from the cleaned data that I made last time, see notebook entry for 2023-05-27), they consist of data like this:

```
fp.3.Luci_01A01.ctg.ctg7180000038417 contig_2945629    10551 11583 16842  0 1035 1035
fp.3.Luci_01A01.ctg.ctg7180000038417 contig_4563296    2786 3906 16842  0 1120 1120
fp.3.Luci_01A01.ctg.ctg7180000038417 fermi10585773772_3178693960    14144 15632 16842  0 1488 1488
```

Then I wrote the Java code for processing the graph and calculate the degree distribution of a file which we write as a `.txt` file called `<filename>_degrees.txt`. This all seemed to work for small cases (the test data).

Then I created a histogram using matplotlib with Python to show the degree distribution of the graph visually, it's very hard to see in linear scale since the degree's are very scattered and some vertices have very large degrees. In log scale you can get some insight though. So I created both logarithmic and linear versions of the histogram.

To get a histogram you have to first run the jar file `GraphProcessor.jar` on the cleaned data file, e.g. (while src is the working directory) `java -Xss1G -Xms24G -jar GraphProcessor ../overlaps.m4/cleaned.m4`. This is what I did to compile the entire cleaned data set with, this now creates a file called `cleaned_degrees.txt` in the overlaps.m4 folder. Then write `python plot_degree_histogram.py ../overlaps.m4/cleaned_degrees.txt` this will create two histograms in pdf format in the overlaps.m4 folder called `cleaned_degrees_linear.png` and `cleaned_degrees_log.png`.
